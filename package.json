### Step 2: Push to GitHub

Now, let's get this folder onto GitHub.

1.  Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and create a **new, empty repository**. Don't add a README or .gitignore.
2.  Open your command line or terminal.
3.  Navigate into your `mt4-dashboard` folder:
    `cd path/to/mt4-dashboard`
4.  Run these git commands, one by one, replacing the GitHub URL with your own:

    ```bash
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial dashboard commit"
    git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    git push -u origin main
